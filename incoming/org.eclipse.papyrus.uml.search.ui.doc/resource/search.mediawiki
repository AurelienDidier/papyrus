In this documentation, we will use two different UML models to illustrate the search features. 

Model 1:

[[image:search-model1.png]]

Model 2 :

[[image:search-model2.png]]

=Search elements=
The search feature of Papyrus helps the user to find elements in the models using a string pattern. It is able to search in string attributes of model elements. 

The search dialog is illustrated in the following image: 

[[image:papyrus-search.png]] 

* The user can specify the string pattern he/she is looking for in the A area. 
** Check the "Case sensitive" if case must be considered. 
** The user may also want to use regular expression to express the query. Then check "Regular expression" button. The regular expression must respect Java Regex
* The user can filter the types of elements to search the string pattern in by selecting the metaclasses in area B whose instances will be analyzed. 
* By default, the search feature will only search in the name attribute of instances of UML::NamedElement. By checking the button in area C, all string attributes will be analyzed
* If button in area D is check, string attributes of stereotypes applied to model elements will be analyzed too. 

For instance, the following search: 

[[image:C-search.png]]

will provide the following results: 

[[image:C-result.png]]

Note that the comment is not returned because we were note looking for all string attributes. 

However, this search:

[[image:comment-search.png]]

will return : 

[[image:comment-result.png]]


=Replace String=
Should the user want to replace the matches of your search with another string, he/she may click on the "Replace" button in the search dialog. A new dialog will popup:

[[Image:replace.png]]

As mentioned on the dialog, the replace action is mostly undoable. Matches that are found in a resource that is not opened in an editor will be replaced and will be save so that the user cannot undo the modification. 

=Filter=
The user can filter the results of the search by selecting the types of the elements he/she wants to show.

For instance, on the following search: 

[[image:my-search.png]]

the user may filter the results by clicking on the icon identified in a red rectangle in the following picture: 

[[image:My-results.png]]

this will open a new dialog where the user can select the metaclasses he/she want to show: 

[[image:filter.png]]

then, the result page will show only the matches of the selected type: 

[[image:my-filtered.png]]

If the user wants to remove this filtering, he/she may click on the Filters button as illustrated in previous picture. This will open the following dialog: 

[[image:select-filters.png]]
