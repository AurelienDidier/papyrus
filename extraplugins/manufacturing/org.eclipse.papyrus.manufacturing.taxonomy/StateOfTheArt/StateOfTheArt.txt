=== Articles===
This approach pretends to realize the vision of cloud computing in the domain of manufacturing. The main idea is to have a cloud of services where a line of assembly uses thoses that are available to fulfill the production requirements at a given stage. These services reconfigure themselves. The chain of events where a client production line invokes a cloud of services, registers for a service and uses it, is all modeled in BPMN.

=5. Smart Factory=
==5.1 Usage of BPMN in smart factories==
Smart factories makes great emphasis on the need of open standards to achieve interoperability, both vertical (across abstraction levels from business to manufacture) and horizontal (between production chains, different control technologies, etc.). For this matter, the International Society Automation's standard ISA-95 is widely recognized as the top norm to design the FoF (factory of the future).

This standard preconizes the use of four abstraction levels:
1. ERP level: Business processes
2. MES level: Manufacturing execution systems, control rooms
3. Control level: Machine controllers, shop floors
4. Device level: Sensors, actuators, machines

It is at the first level, where technologies such as BPM/SOA have demonstrated great success for classical business processes, and can now demonstrate its expressive power for the levels below; namely, for the description of industrial control processes. The mapping between both levels is achieved thanks to the B2MML standard.

==5.2 What is specific==
The article defines the principles for the Factory of the Future, and the importance of process modeling and SoA for the first level of ISA-95. A big importance is also given to standardisation as means to achieve interoperability.

==5.3 Problems in manufactories process==
* need guides to make modeling
* need to add Sequence diagram to express temporal behavior perspective about exectuion of manufacturing process.
* Need abstract representations of process models

===Defining a Methodology to Design and Implement Business Process Models in BPMN According to the Standard ANSI/ISA-95 in a Manufacturing Enterprise===
summary: Adapdation of BPMN to support a part of the standad ANSI/ISA-95, modeling with BPMN  MES by referencing ANSI/ISA-95 Control System Integration Standard.
They propose  a methodology in 3 steps: Partial model of discrete manufacturing industry, particular model of discrete manufacturing industry,  and extension of partial model to new situation

=== Towards a factory of things===
- Probably a good way to divide by views the modeling of Smart Factories. The view "Service Model" could be one of the views that can be supported by the Papyurs Editor.

===Agent-based processes in Smart Factories===
Summary: Manufacturing processes in the Smart Factories paradigm are required to be highly flexible, readily modifiable and adaptable to constraints related to resources and market requirements. This article suggests the idea of modeling manufacturing processes as the interaction of intelligent agents, who self-adapt to the constraints of the environment. To this end, it proposes business modeling based on the S-BPM(Subject-based Business Process Modeling) formalism. Issued from the original BPM approach, it conceives the set of activities as actions perfomed by subjects who take the role of a certain agent in the process. These interactions and self-adaptation mechanics are modeled in BPMN.

===Cyber-physical systems in Smart Factories===
The concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS) deals with systems that create an interface between the real world, sensing situations through physical interactions, and the cybernetic world where systems react to these situations by executing a determined behavior. It is linked with the approach of agent-based processes in the sense that the ultimate goal is to achieve fast self-adaptation to environment changes. This makes sense in the context of smart factories, since networks of sensors - a core topic on cyber-physical systems - are a core asset in the factory of the future. In this article, BPMN is proposed to model the interactions between these CPS which together carry out the execution of a manufacturing process. In this sense, BPMN will have to propose an extension to capture the subtilities of this approach, such as the different types of events.

=6. Event-Driven Manufacturing Process Management=
It offers a helpful table of example events across the ISA-95 levels 2, 3 and 4, across four phases of the manufacturing process: Quality, production, mainteinance and energy. It shows how a series of single low-level events can be aggregated to infer high-level complex events. The mechanisms for this are inspired from Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and these could be: Event Algebra, textual languages such as Rapide, inference engines such as Drools. In any case, event-driven handling is itself a process and it is performed by three roles:
-Event producers
-Complex event producers
-Complex event consumers
It also discuses Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) in manufacturing by proposing how to develop Key Performance Indicators. KPIs are computed from low-level events, such as sensor data.

==6.1 Usage of BPMN in EDMPM==
BPMN 2.0 provides a palette of events including complex ones which are the agregation of several simple events, as well as signals for propagation. The approach shows the previous event handling process modeled in BPMN. In the context of BAM, there is a proposal to compute and monitor KPIs.
An architecture solution is designed, to be implemented on top of a classic BPM engine, which implements event queues.

==6.2 What is specific==
The use of EDA principles to handle manufacturing events and replicate them across the automation pyramid.

==6.3 Problems==
The BPM engine must be highly specialized in the handling of events and its computation.
The proposed approach must integrate with the software that is commonly used for plant design and simulation, and manufacturing execution systems (MES), which themselves should provide an interface so the BPM engine can interact with them to generate and receive events.
