<h1>Connectors</h1>

As in UML, a connector is an element that links two or more parts (or ports of parts) within a
composition. In UML, the connector only denotes that there is a connection, it does not carry further
annotations that characterize the interaction or how it is implemented.
<br>
In Qompass, a connector carries additional information (via the FCM profile) about a type or implementation
used for its realization, the connector component. It is important to keep in mind that these two are quite
different elements: (1) the connector which is merely a "wire" and (2) the referencing connector component.
Sometimes, the terminlogy is a bit sloppy and we use the term connector for a connector component, if the
context is clear.<br>
  
A connector component is quite similar to a standard component: there is an optional separation
between its type and its implementation, it owns ports, it may be a composition.
The main difference is that it needs to be generic, since the connector component has to adapt itself
to the environment in which it is used, e.g. to the interfaces of ports it connectors.
The following figure shows a connector and the referenced connector component. The tool chain
<i>reifies</i> a connector to a connector component during deployment, as shown in the following figure:

<h2>Selecting connectors</h2>
The Qompass tool supports the selection of a suitable connector type or implementation by means of
a dialog which can be found in the context menu (once a connector is selected.
