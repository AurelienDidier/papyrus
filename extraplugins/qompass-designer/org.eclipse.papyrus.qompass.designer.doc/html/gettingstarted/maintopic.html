<h1>Getting Started</h1>
There is a cheat sheet that describes the creation of an Qompass application. It can be found
on Help - Cheat sheets.

An Qompass application description consists basically on three parts:<ul>
<li>the component model
<li>a platform description and
<li>a deployment plan that describes the instances, their configuration and their allocation on a
  node of the platform
</ul>

The component model is based on the UML component model with two extensions
<a href="connectors.html">connectors</a> and <a href="containers.html">containers</a>.

There are three different role, how you can use Qompass:<ol>
<li>As an application developer
<li>As a developer of additional interaction mechanisms and/or container extensions
<li>As a developer of the transformation code behind Qompass.
