<h1>Qompass developer guide</h1>

Qompass consists of a set of plugins:
<ul>
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer. This plugin contains the definition of the Qompass feature
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.updateSite: definition of the update site
<p>
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.examples: This plugin contains a set of examples and tests
<li><a href="org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.core.html">org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.core:</a> The main Qompass plugin
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.cpp: A plugin with support for C++, in particular (1) for the creation
  and configuration of Eclipse CDT projects and (2) the interaction with the C++ code generator. 
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.description A small plugin providing the "description" view which
	provides the easy way to describe model elements (via owned comments stereotyped by FCM)
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.packaging: Supports the generation of IDL files from the component model as well
	as a <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CCM/">CCM</a> compatible deployment descriptor from a deployment plan 
</ul>

<p>
In addition to the generation plugins, Qompass contains a set of model libraries that are
dedicated for a specific domain and/or interaction mechanisms.

<ul>
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.modellibs.core: A set of basic interaction mechanisms and container rules as well
	as portkinds along with the calculation of provided and required interface from the port type
	and kind ("mapping rules").
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.modellibs.marte: A modeling library for MARTE, contains a set of FCM port kinds
	suitable for MARTE (client/server and flow ports) and model elements for RtUnit and PpUnit.
	A model listener performs automatic synchronization between MARTE and FCM stereotypes, e.g.
	will automatically initialize the FCM port kind attribute with the kind that corresponds to
	the MARTE stereotype and apply container rules associated with Rtunit and Ppunit. 
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.modellibs.distribution: Distribution support via sockets
<li>org.eclipse.papyrus.qompass.designer.modellibs.tracing: Tracing support (container rule and interceptor) for OTF
</ul>
