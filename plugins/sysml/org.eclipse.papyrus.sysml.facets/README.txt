The goal of this plugin : 
	- provide facets to represent and edit the SysML elements in the Papyrus Table. The facets allow to 
	represent and edit stereotypes properties. 

the goal of extendedsysml : 
	This model provides the Enumeration NAFlowPortDirection. This Enumeration is used to display N/A in the FlowPortDirection
	when the port is not atomic. So the Facet "Direction" extends Enumerator and not FlowDirection to allow this behavior.
