===org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable===
*bug 517617 and bug 532452 (ensure the selection don't change after some user actions)
We change the storage of the current selection, but we keep the algorithm provided by '''TableSelectionProvider''', but we change the manipulation and the storages of the informations. 

**'''TableSelectionProvider'''
***new method '''setActive(boolean)''' to allow to listen or not the selection changes
**'''TableSelectionWrapper'''
***new constructor '''TableSelectionWrapper(final INattableModelManager manager, final SelectionLayer selectionLayer, final Collection<PositionCoordinate> selectionCells)''', 
all others are deprecated and will be removed.
***new methods '''updatePositions''', to update position of referenced elements (rows/columns/cells) after a refresh
***new methods '''buildSingleCellSelection''', '''getSelectedElements''', '''getSingleSelectedCells''', '''addSelectedRow''', '''addSelectedColumn''', '''removeSelectedRow''', '''removeSelectedColumn''', '''copyRowsSelection''', '''copyColumnsSelection'''
***methods '''getFullySelectedRows''' and '''getFullySelectedColumns''' changed without breaking API: before the returned map used the row index as key, and now this same map use the row position as key. To obtain the row index, you must call '''selectionLayer.getRowIndexByPosition'''
