It is able to search in string attributes of model elements. </p><p>The search dialog is illustrated in the following image: </p><p><img border="0" src="papyrus-search.png"/> </p><ul><li>The user can specify the string pattern he/she is looking for in the A area. <ul><li>Check the "Case sensitive" if case must be considered. </li><li>The user may also want to use regular expression to express the query. Then check "Regular expression" button. The regular expression must respect Java Regex</li></ul></li><li>The user can filter the types of elements to search the string pattern in by selecting the metaclasses in area B whose instances will be analyzed. </li><li>By default, the search feature will only search in the name attribute of instances of UML::NamedElement. By checking the button in area C, all string attributes will be analyzed</li><li>If button in area D is check, string attributes of stereotypes applied to model elements will be analyzed too. </li></ul><p>For instance, the following search: </p><p><img border="0" src="C-search.png"/></p><p>will provide the following results: </p><p><img border="0" src="C-result.png"/></p><p>Note that the comment is not returned because we were note looking for all string attributes. </p><p>However, this search:</p><p><img border="0" src="comment-search.png"/></p><p>will return : </p><p><img border="0" src="comment-result.png"/></p><h1 id="Replace_String">Replace String</h1><p>Should the user want to replace the matches of your search with another string, he/she may click on the "Replace" button in the search dialog. A new dialog will popup:</p><p><img border="0" src="replace.png"/></p><p>As mentioned on the dialog, the replace action is mostly undoable. Matches that are found in a resource that is not opened in an editor will be replaced and will be save so that the user cannot undo the modification. </p><h1 id="Filter">Filter</h1><p>The user can filter the results of the search by selecting the types of the elements he/she wants to show.</p><p>For instance, on the following search: </p><p><img border="0" src="my-search.png"/></p><p>the user may filter the results by clicking on the icon identified in a red rectangle in the following picture: </p><p><img border="0" src="My-results.png"/></p><p>this will open a new dialog where the user can select the metaclasses he/she want to show: </p><p><img border="0" src="filter.png"/></p><p>then, the result page will show only the matches of the selected type: </p><p><img border="0" src="my-filtered.png"/></p><p>If the user wants to remove this filtering, he/she may click on the Filters button as illustrated in previous picture. This will open the following dialog: </p><p><img border="0" src="select-filters.png"/></p><p><hr/>
