Some validations are available to validate the customizations of Papyrus:
* Validation of a created '''profile''' into a plug-in
* Validation of '''element types''' plug-in
* Validation of '''architecture''' plug-in

==Profile plug-in validation==
===What is checked?===
To validate a profile plug-in, we have some points to check. Here are the checked points:
* For each profile found in the plug-in:
** Validation of the profile definition into the 'plugin.xml' file: '''ERROR''' (for 'generated_package' extension) and '''WARNING''' (for 'UMLProfile' extension)
** Validate that the profile has no definition because it's not working with static profile: '''ERROR'''
** Validation of the dependencies needed in the 'MANIFEST.MF' file for the external dependencies of the profile file: '''WARNING''' (because maybe the dependency is not really needed (implicit dependence?))
** Validation of the 'build.properties' file (it must contain the profile file): '''ERROR'''

===How to do it?===
When you create a plug-in containing a profile, you can validate this one with the validation toolsmiths.
To do this, select the project, then ''''Papyrus Developer''''>''''Validate Profile plug-in'''':

When you do a validation, the result of old profile plug-in validation are clean and the current problems are displayed in the corresponding view.

===Where find the result?===
The result is display in the ''''Problems'''' view and are categorized by the type ''''Papyrus Toolsmiths Profile Plug-in problems''''.

Like others problems, you can double-click on one to open the concerning file. You can delete problem too when you think it is managed.

==Element types plug-in validation==
===What is checked?===
To validate a element types plug-in, we have some points to check. Here are the checked points:
* Validation of the needed dependencies: '''WARNING'''
** 'org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types.core'
** 'org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.type.core'
** 'org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types'
** 'org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.edit'
** 'org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types'
** 'org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.utils'
* For each element types files found in the plug-in:
** Validation of the element types file itself: '''ERROR'''
** Validation of the element types definition into the 'plugin.xml' file: '''ERROR'''
** Validation of the dependencies needed in the 'MANIFEST.MF' file for the external dependencies of the element types file: '''WARNING''' (because maybe the dependency is not really needed (implicit dependence?))

===How to do it?===
When you create a plug-in containing an element types file, you can validate this one with the validation toolsmiths.
To do this, select the project, then ''''Papyrus Developer''''>''''Validate Element types plug-in'''':

[[File:images/devDoc/Papyrus_ValidationElementTypesMenu.png|frame|none|Menu to validate element types plug-in]]

When you do a validation, the result of old element types plug-in validation are clean and the current problems are displayed in the corresponding view.

===Where find the result?===
The result is display in the ''''Problems'''' view and are categorized by the type ''''Papyrus Toolsmiths Element Types Plug-in problems''''.

==Architecture plug-in validation==
===What is checked?===
To validate an architecture plug-in, we have some points to check. Here are the checked points:
* Validation of the needed dependencies: '''ERROR'''
** 'org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture'
* For each architecture files found in the plug-in:
** Validation of the architecture file itself: '''ERROR'''
** Validation of the architecture definition into the 'plugin.xml' file: '''ERROR'''
** Validation of the dependencies needed in the 'MANIFEST.MF' file for the external dependencies of the architecture file: '''WARNING''' (because maybe the dependency is not really needed (implicit dependence?))
** Validation of the 'build.properties' file (it must contain the architecture file): '''ERROR'''

===How to do it?===
When you create a plug-in containing an architecture definition, you can validate this one with the validation toolsmiths.
To do this, select the project, then ''''Papyrus Developer''''>''''Validate Architecture plug-in'''':

[[File:images/devDoc/Papyrus_ValidationArchitectureMenu.png|frame|none|Menu to validate architecture plug-in]]

When you do a validation, the result of old architecture plug-in validation are clean and the current problems are displayed in the corresponding view.

===Where find the result?===
The result is display in the ''''Problems'''' view and are categorized by the type ''''Papyrus Toolsmiths Architecture Plug-in problems''''.
