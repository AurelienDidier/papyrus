=How To Create a TableConfiguration From a Table?=
#Install the plugin '''com.cea.papyrus.infra.nattable.export''' in your Eclipse, then restart.
#Create a new Papyrus Project
#Create a new Table
##To create a configuration for a flat or a tree table, we recommend to create a '''Generic Tree Table'''.
##To create a configuration for a matrix table, we recommend to create a '''Relationship Generic Matrix'''.
#Configure your table.
#Export your table '''Right-Click > Export As Table Configuration''' or in Eclipse Menu '''File > Export > Papyrus > Export As Table Configuration''', then follow the wizard.

==Description of the Wizard==
*''Optional page'':
**If your configured table is not a '''Generic Tree Table''' or a '''Relationship Generic Matrix''', a warning page will be displayed

You can cancel or continue after this page.
*''First page'':
**you must select an existing '''plugin''' as output of the table configuration file

*''Second page'':
**You must define the name and the type of your new table configuration. The description is not mandatory.

After clicking on '''Finish''', in some case, we open a dialog, when we think the created TableConfiguration references others files which are not expected. In this case, we advice you to check them manually
and fill us a bug if required.

==Description of the result==
*a new '''nattableconfiguration''' file has been created in the new folder '''tableConfiguration''',
*the extension point '''org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.configuration''' in the '''plugin.xml''' file has been filled,
*a folder '''icons''' has been created. It owns the icon to use for the new table,
*the following dependencies have been added in the '''MANIFEST.MF''' file:
**'''org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable'''
**If you use your new configuration in a RCP, don't forget, to include these plugins to your table feature:
***'''org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.common''' (required to get the table editor),
***'''org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.properties''' (to get Table Properties View),
***'''org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.nattable''' (required for UML table),
***'''org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.nattable.matrix''' (required for Matrix),
***'''org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.nattable.properties''' (required for Matrix Properties View).
*the files and folders to include to the binary build have been added to the '''build.properties''' file.
