Papyrus for UML provides a UML 2 modeling environment that conforms to the OMG specification. Papyrus for UML notably features diagram editors for UML 2 diagrams, rich model editing facilities, and the glue required to integrate with other model-based tools. It also offers a very advanced support of UML profiles that enables users to define UML-based domain-specific modeling languages.To complement the UML profiles support, Papyrus provides very powerful customization mechanisms which can be leveraged to create user-defined Papyrus perspectives and give it the same look andfeel as a native DSL editor. \n\
